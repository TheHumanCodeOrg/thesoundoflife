Hey all,

This is Chuck S., Prime Minister of Clean Records
here in Albuquerque, NM <Insert shameless commercial
plug HERE>.

I sampled EVERY drum/percussion sound from Roland's MC-303
(which is, for those who don't know, an attempt to revamp
the legendary TB-303 for us here in the 90's). I didn't
notice it at this site and I thought I would let you have it.
These were sampled on a Kurzweil 2500 in mono @ 44.1Khz,
bone dry. I did not include any 909 or 808 samples from the
303 (isn't techno babble great?) because I thought this was
well covered territory at this site. Unfortunately, in my
humble opinion, I think the MC-303 was a muddy sounding
disaster but with a little EQ these samples might prove
usefull.

If you would like to know more about Clean Records or are
interested in swapping ideas, tips, tricks, etc. e-mail me:
