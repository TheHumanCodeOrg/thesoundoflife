The file univox.zip is a complete sample set of the Univox Micro-Rhythmer 12, 
a little-known but very nice analog drum box.    Thanks go out to Dave 
Daydodge of Minneapolis for letting me borrow his.

I sampled all 12 of the preset rhythms and all 4 of the individual sounds by 
themselves.  All the loops should be at about the same tempo but might be 
cut kinda badly, I didn't spend alot of time zeroing in on the best sample 
length.  The only problem with the individual sounds is that I had to cut 
them out of the preset loops and the bass drum never occurs by itself, so it 
is layered with a closed hi-hat.  All the samples are normalized and are 16 
bit mono WAV files.  

I hope you find this set useful.  Please feel free to copy or distribute
the set in any way.  Please DO NOT change samples, add samples,
delete samples, or modify this text file in any way.  Respect the work. 
This sample set is FREE.  You may not distribute these samples for
profit!!   If you have any comments please feel free to email me.
