I have found the Univox Micro-Rhythmer 12 sample set, that Rob Williams
made, to be just what i needed to add a bit of variation to the typical
analog drum sounds from my Roland TR-808 drum machine.

In this set Rob sampled the 12 presets and also extracted the 4 individual
sounds from these preset rhythms. He noted:

 "The only problem with the individual sounds is that I had to cut 
  them out of the preset loops and the bass drum never occurs by itself, so 
  it is layered with a closed hi-hat."  

Well, with the magic of digital signal processing, i isolated completely
the drum sound to have a massive boom without compressing the hell out
of the mix. The file is 44.1 kHz, mono, 16 bit, Microsoft WAV format and
it is normalised with background noise is at -70dB.

Rob's set is available on hyperreal.com, in the music machines samples
directory, like this file. He can be reached at feed@maroon.tc.umn.edu
