Korg DDM-110 Digital Drum Machine Sample Pack
---------------------------------------------
Sampled by: Jed Haldeman

This sample pack is a collection of the samples I pulled
from my Korg DDM-110. Its a crappy little piece of electronic
music gear, but it only cost me $40. I hated using the thing
because of its touchy, cheap, plastic buttons and terribly difficult 
to program sequencer (not to mention no midi support, and no volume
control for any of the individual sounds, except hihats.. ???).
.... so I sampled this little bad boy because the sounds were kind of
cool being so crappy and obviously electronic. 

All sounds were recorded at 44.1 KHz 16-bit mono standard MS Wav format

Included are all the sounds the DDM-110 makes, which are:
